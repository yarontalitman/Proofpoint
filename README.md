First question: in order to find the missing number I used the fact that the array size is 9 instead of 10 or n-1 if the array size was n, I used the formula (n+1)*n/2 to calculate 
the sum from the first to the last number, after that I found the sum of the array elemnts and sunstracted it.
Second question: first I set the sum to 0, then with a while loop I got an input from the user until it is "stop" if it is an integer I have added it to sum.
